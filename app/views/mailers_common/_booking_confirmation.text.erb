Please arrive 45 minutes before your visit starts.

Visitors unable to attend this visit

<% if @confirmation.visitor_not_listed %>
* <%= @confirmation.unlisted_visitors.inject([]){ |array, (visitor)| array << first_name(visitor) + ' ' + (initial ? last_initial(visitor) : last_name(visitor)) }.join(', ') %> cannot attend as they’re not on the prisoner’s contact list
<% end %>
<% if @confirmation.visitor_banned %>
* <%= @confirmation.banned_visitors.inject([]){ |array, (visitor)| array << first_name(visitor) + ' ' + (initial ? last_initial(visitor) : last_name(visitor)) }.join(', ') %> cannot attend as they’re currently banned
<% end %>
<% if @confirmation.visitor_not_listed %>

Visitors not on contact lists need to ask prisoners to update their lists with correct details, making sure that names appear exactly the same as on ID documents.
<% end %>
<% if @confirmation.visitor_banned %>

Banned visitors should have received a letter to say that they’re banned from visiting the prison at the moment. Get in touch with the prison for more information.
<% end %>
<% end %>
<% if @confirmation.closed_visit %>

This is a closed visit: the prisoner will be behind a glass screen in a separate area rather than in the visiting hall.
<% end %>
