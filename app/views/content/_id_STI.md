Please make sure you bring ID with you. This can be ONE item from the first list, or TWO from the second list below.

Itâ€™s important that your ID shows your current home address. So if you bring a passport, you'll also need an official letter showing your address, eg a bank statement or benefits letter.

ONE item from this list:

* passport, including foreign passports, and expired passports where the photograph is still recognisable (proof of address will also be required)
* identity card (including European identity cards)
* driving licence
* senior citizen's public transport photo pass issued by a local authority
* employer's or student ID card but only if this has a photo and clearly shows your name and the issuing employer or educational establishment

Or TWO items from this list:

* birth or marriage certificate
* benefit letters
* credit or debit card with bank statement
* employer's pass or ID or student ID card without photo
* young person's 'proof of age' card
* trade union or National Students' Union membership card
* tenancy agreement
* foreign identity or residents' card
